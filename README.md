# Slider-bar-game-using-Turtle-Python
This is a game made wholly using turtle library or module in python 
For sound, I have used a module named winsound which is already installed in python
For pausing a process, I have used a module named time which is already installed in python

In case there is any module error, write this in the command line:
pip install winsound
pip install turtle
pip install time
